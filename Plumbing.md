# Plumbing
Sanitary Tee (SanTee) – These are “T” shaped fittings between pipes. There is an extremely slight angle, it is NOT a 90* connection.
Wye – These are “Y” shaped fittings between pipes. These will often be paired with a 1/8 bend (a 45* curved pipe segment) for connecting a vertical drain pipe to a horizontal drain pipe.
Sanitary Combo – These are wye fittings and a 1/8 bend combined into a single segment of pipe.
 
## Kitchen Sink
When connecting a dishwasher, you must add a high-rise loop to the drain before the P-Trap. You also do not want this drain connecting to a garbage disposal, because that will push dirty water back into the dishwasher. The high-rise loop is designed to prevent wastewater from the sink from entering the dishwasher. The loop should also be attached to the underside of the sink, and it is recommended that it drains into the vertical section of the sink drain right before the P-Trap. The high loop SHOULD be sufficient to prevent back siphoning into the dishwasher, but if you STILL see it then you may need to install an air gap in the high-rise loop.
P-Trap – Must have a liquid “seal” of no less than 2” and no more than 4”
Below Grade
When installing fixtures below grade (below ground level or something lower than the “master” drain) you must use a pump to facilitate draining. Typically, you’d use gravity to assist draining, but this can’t be done here. The toilets must be a special type of toilet as well, the drain is at the back of the toilet pointing to the side as opposed to the bottom of the toilet pointing down. These toilets are called macerating toilets because the pump in the tank grinds or macerates the waste. These are necessary because you cannot break the concrete foundation in many below grade installations.
You can get a macerating toilet that’s combined with a pump and feed all fixture drains to that pump, but if there are fixtures too far away you can also buy separate pumps. When the pump goes out you’ll have to replace the entire toilet, which can be expensive.
If possible, the best way would be to use a sewage ejector pump, which is installed in the ground. With a sewer ejector pump, you would route all drains to the pump like normal (i.e. you would use a normal toilet).

## Venting
The vent must be located within a certain distance from the trap of a fixture. This distance is defined by the “size of the trap” (I don’t know what size of the trap means) and the slope of the drain. The size of the vent is determined by the size of the drain that continues downstream (906.2). Drain size is determined by fixture unit load (709.1/2, 710.1(1)/1(2).
Vents may be merged, but the connection must be at least 6 inches above the flood-level rim of the highest fixture served.
Vents exceeding 40 feet in length shall be increased by one nominal pipe size for the entire length of the vent pipe.
Vent Stacks are required for every drainage stack that has 5 branch intervals or more. Vent stacks are required to be dry and are required to connect at or near the base of the drainage stack.
With more than 10 branch intervals, you will need a relief vent. This is an additional vent stack besides the “main” vent stack. This is for public bathrooms and stuff, so just keep it in mind.
When using a common vent, you may connect fixture drains at different heights, but there must be a minimum of 2” of drain between the connections.
You may use a wet vent, but there is regulation about the number and types of fixtures that can be attached to a horizontal wet vent. There are also regulations regarding the vertical wet vent and the order in which certain types of fixtures are attached.
Circuit Vents are similar to wet vents, but have some extra specificities. 

## Glossary
Flood-level Rim - The point or edge at which water will spill out on the floor from a fixture.
Vent Stack – A section of vent that runs parallel to the drainpipe. Normally the drainpipe will also serve as the vent, but if you have 5 or more branched connections to the vent you will need an additional vent besides the drain.
Stack Vent – The top most section of a drain after the vent stack is connected to it.
Common Vent – This is a when 2 (multiple?) fixtures use the same singular vent. This is okay if they are located on the same floor level.
Wet Vent – This is a combination drain/vent. A wet vent is essentially using a larger than necessary drainpipe so that you will have a larger space above the water for draining. Wet vents may be horizontal and/or vertical.
Circuit Vent – This is a specialized wet vent that allows you to combine a total of 8 fixtures on a single floor that are not limited to the two bathroom groups.
Drain Fixture Unit (DFU) – A unit of measure for the hydraulic load imposed by a fixture on the plumbing installation. 1 sink would be 1 DFU, for example.
FD – Floor Drain
LAV – Lavatories are sinks that are specifically fixtures used for washing in toilet and/or bathing facilities.
WC – Water Closet (toilet)

## General
Chemical Energy vs Electrical Energy vs Mechanical Energy.
Sump – A low space that collects often undesirable liquids, such as water or chemicals.
