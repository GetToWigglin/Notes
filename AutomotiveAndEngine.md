#Automobile/Engine Notes
### Compression Ratio
Compression ratio is the ratio of the volume of the cylinder between top dead center (TDC) and bottom dead center (BDC). TDC is when the piston in the cylinder is the farthest from the crankshaft, or the piston is at “full-extension” and the combustion chamber is the most compressed. BDC is when the piston is closest to the crankshaft, or at “full-retraction” and the combustion chamber is the most open. In other words, compression ratio is the maximum operating volume of the cylinder over the minimum operating volume of the cylinder.
Internal combustion engines (ICEs) convert chemical energy in gasoline into mechanical energy in pistons.
### Four-Stroke Combustion Cycles
Intake Stroke – Compression Stroke – Combustion Stroke – Exhaust Stroke
A power cycle goes through four events and each event is isolated mechanically. 
### Two-Stroke Combustion Cycle
In two-stroke engines, a single event completes the cycle of intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust. Each revolution of the crankshaft involves combustion, which makes 2-stroke engines put out more power than 4-stroke engines.
There are no intake or exhaust valves, and instead get the oxygen for the combustion from tiny “scavenging ports” in the cylinder wall. I guess this is why you don’t get complete combustion in a 2-stroke engine, because the exhaust and intake replacement are less efficient, and you don’t always get enough oxygen for each combustion. In addition, you are getting lubricating oils inside the combustion chamber which will result in more pollutants.
2-Stroke engines require lubrication added to the fuel mixture because the fuel and air mixture pass through the crankcase before hitting the combustion chamber. In 4-stroke engines, the crankcase is isolated from the induction tract, so it must be supplied lubrication separately. The crankcase is part of the induction tract BY DEFINITION in a 2-stroke engine, because it would require more strokes to pull in lubrication elsewhere.
### Induction Tract
This is the system of the engine that handles transporting air and fuel to the combustion chamber. Includes fuel injectors, intake manifold, throttle body and air metering devices, intake valves, and air filter assembly.
### Crankcase
This is the housing that surrounds the crankshaft. This is where the lubrication must be applied because it surrounds the crankshaft and pistons and those are the moving parts inside the engine. Crankcases that isolate the lubrication use either a dry or wet sump. A wet sump is where the oil reservoir is contained within the crankcase while a dry sump is where the oil is pumped from a separate reservoir to the crankcase. Wet sumps are more common, and when you look at the bottom of the car, the oil pan that you see is holding the oil and the crankshaft is sitting right inside it.
### Gasoline Engine
Fuel is first mixed with air and then compressed by pistons. It is then ignited by sparks from spark plugs.
### Diesel Engine
Air is compressed BEFORE it gets mixed with fuel. The air heats up when compressed, so that heat generated is what ignites the fuel.
