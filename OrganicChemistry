# Describing Things
Benzene – Carbon rings.
Phenyl Groups – A molecule that has at least one end terminating in a benzene ring
Isomer – A group that is branched and not a straight chain, such as Isopropyl or i-Pr 2(CH2)(CH3). The chained version is called “normal” and is notated as just Propyl or n-Pr 2(CH2)(CH3). These are “n-alkyl”. Isomers may also have different functional groups.
Primary, secondary, tertiary – These are prefixes that indicate how many carbons are connected to a carbon atom. For example, tert-butanol is an alcohol containing a tertiary carbon atom, meaning that it is connected to 3 other carbon atoms.

## Functional Groups
Alkyl Group – Hydrocarbon chains that are missing an H, so that they may interact with other parts. For example: Methyl, Ethyl, Propyl, and Butyl. These are distinguished by n-1 CH2 groups connected to a CH3 group.
Alkanes – Hydrocarbon chains + H, these contain no functional groups
Alkenes – Only hydrocarbon groups and at least one double bond between carbons
Alkynes – Only hydrocarbon groups and at least one triple bond between carbons
Alcohols (R-OH) – Contain a hydroxyl (OH) group. Living things use the OH groups to attach these to otherwise insoluble organic compounds. The liver detoxifies unwanted organic compounds by repeatedly hydroxylating them until they are water soluble, then they are excreted via the bile or urine.
Ethers (R-O-R) – Contain an alkoxy group (-OR). These are any compound that has two alkyl groups linked by an oxygen atom. Diethyl ether is the ether referred to colloquially as “ether”.
Amines (R-NH2) – Contain the amino group (NH2). Putrescine is an amine as well as many neurologically active compounds, such as amphetamine.
Nitro Compounds (R-NO2) – Contain the nitro group (NH2). Often nitro groups are drawn incorrectly with 5 bonds to nitrogen.
Alkyl Halides (R-F, R-Cl, R-Br, R-I) – Contain the fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo groups. These all behave similarly even though they are attached to different elements. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is an example of an alkyl halide. Alkyl halides can sometimes be represented as R-X, with the X representing the halide portion. These are called halides, because the non-alkyl part is a halogen atom.
Aldehydes (R-CHO) and Ketones (R-CO-R2) – Contain the carbonyl group (C=O). These are formed by oxidizing alcohols.
Carboxylic Acids (R-CO2H, R-COOH) – Contain the carboxyl group (COOH). These can react with bases to form carboxylate salts. Citric acid is a carboxylic acid.
Esters (R1-COOR2) – Contain an alkyl group connected to a carboxyl group with a separate different alkyl group. These typically have fruity smells and flavors.
Amides (R-CONH2, R1-CONH2R2, or R1-CONH2R2R3) – These are created when the carboxylic group of one amino acid condenses with the amino group of another to form an amide linkage (peptide bond).
Nitriles or Cyanides (R-CN) – Contain the cyano group (C---O [Triple bond]). These are created by reacting potassium cyanide with alkyl halides.
Acyl Chlorides/Acid Chlorides (R-COCl) – These are reactive compounds used to make esters and amides. They are derived from carboxylic acids and are too reactive to be found in nature.
Acetals – Compounds with two oxygen atoms bonded to the same carbon atom.
