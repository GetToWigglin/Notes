## Freezing
Vitrification is a type of freezing that occurs so quickly that the liquid does not have time to settle into a crystalline form (Repeated segments).

Freezing can be divided into two different processes, Heterogenous Nucleation and Homogenous Nucleation.
Nucleation is the process in which molecules of a liquid start to gather in clusters that define the repeated form of a crystalline structure.
Heterogenous nucleation involves a "seed" or "nucleus" such as an impurity or disturbance to start the process.
Homogenous nucleation involves a nucleus forming only with liquid in question.
